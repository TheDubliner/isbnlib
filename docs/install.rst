Install
=======

From the command line enter (in some cases you have to preced the
command with ``sudo``):


.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install isbnlib

or:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install isbnlib-3.9.8.tar.gz

(first you have to download the file!)


If you use linux systems, you can install using your distribution package
manager (all major distributions have packages ``python-isbnlib``
and ``python3-isbnlib``), however (usually) are **very old and don't work well anymore**!
