Note
----

   The official form of an ISBN is something like ``ISBN 979-10-90636-07-1``. However for most
   applications only the numbers are important and you can always masked them if you need (see below).
   This library works mainly with 'striped' ISBNs  (only numbers and X) like '0826497527'. You can
   strip an ISBN's like string by using ``canonical(isbnlike)``. You can
   'mask' the ISBN by using ``mask(isbn)``. So in the examples below, when you see 'isbn'
   in the argument, it is a 'striped' ISBN, when the argument is an 'isbnlike' it is a string
   like ``ISBN 979-10-90636-07-1`` or even something dirty like ``asdf 979-10-90636-07-1 bla bla``.

   Two important concepts: **valid ISBN** should be an ISBN that was built according with the rules,
   this is distinct from **issued ISBN** that is an ISBN that was already issued to a publisher
   (this is the usage of the libraries and most of the web services).
   However *isbn.org*, probably by legal reasons, merges the two!
   So, according to *isbn.org*, '9786610326266' is not valid (because the block 978-66... has not been issued yet,
   however if you use ``is_isbn13('9786610326266')`` you will get ``True`` (because '9786610326266' follows
   the rules of an ISBN). But the situation is even murkier, try ``meta('9786610326266')`` and you will
   see that this ISBN was already used!


   If possible, work with ISBNs in the isbn-13 format (since 2007, only are issued ISBNs in the isbn-13
   format). You can always convert isbn-10 to isbn-13, but **not** the reverse.

API's Main Namespaces
---------------------

In the namespace ``isbnlib`` you have access to the core methods:

``is_isbn10(isbn10like)``
  Validates as ISBN-10.

``is_isbn13(isbn13like)``
  Validates as ISBN-13.

``to_isbn10(isbn13)``
  Transforms an isbn-13 to isbn-10.

``to_isbn13(isbn10)``
  Transforms an isbn-10 to isbn-13.

``canonical(isbnlike)``
  Keeps only numbers and X. You will get strings like `9780321534965`.

``clean(isbnlike)``
  Cleans ISBN (only legal characters).

``notisbn(isbnlike, level='strict')``
  Check with the goal to invalidate isbn-like.

``get_isbnlike(text, level='normal')``
  Extracts all substrings that seem like ISBNs (very useful for scraping).

``get_canonical_isbn(isbnlike, output='bouth')``
  Extracts ISBNs and transform them to the canonical form.

``EAN13(isbnlike)``
  Transforms an `isbnlike` string into an EAN13 number (validated canonical ISBN-13).

``info(isbn)``
  Gets the language or country assigned to this ISBN.

``mask(isbn, separator='-')``
  `Mask` (hyphenate) a canonical ISBN.

``meta(isbn, service='default', cache='default')``
    Gives you the main metadata associated with the ISBN. As `service` parameter you can use:
    ``'goob'`` uses the **Google Books service** (**no key is needed**)  and
    **is the default option**,
    ``'openl'`` uses the **OpenLibrary.org** api (**no key is needed**).
    You can enter API keys
    with ``config.add_apikey(service, apikey)`` (see example below).
    The output can be formatted as ``bibtex``, ``csl`` (CSL-JSON), ``msword``, ``endnote``, ``refworks``,
    ``opf`` or ``json`` (BibJSON) bibliographic formats with ``isbnlib.registry.bibformatters``.
    ``cache`` only allows two values: 'default' or None. You can change the kind of cache by using
    ``isbnlib.registry.set_cache`` (see below).
    Now, you can extend the functionality of this function by adding pluggins, more metadata
    providers or new bibliographic formatters (check_ for available pluggins).

``editions(isbn, service='merge')``
    Returns the list of ISBNs of editions related with this ISBN. By default
    uses 'merge' (merges 'openl' and 'thingl'), but other providers are available:
    'openl' users **Open Library**, 'thingl' (uses the service ThingISBN from **LibraryThing**)
    and 'any' (first tries 'openl', if no data, then 'thingl').

``isbn_from_words(words)``
  Returns the most probable ISBN from a list of words (for your geographic area).

``goom(words)``
  Returns a list of references from **Google Books multiple references**.

``doi(isbn)``
  Returns a DOI's ISBN-A from a ISBN-13.

``doi2tex(DOI)``
  Returns metadata formated as BibTeX for a given DOI.

``ren(filename)``
  Renames a file using metadata from an ISBN in his filename.

``desc(isbn)``
  Returns a small description of the book.
  *Almost all data available are for US books!*

``cover(isbn)``
  Returns a dictionary with the url for cover.
  *Almost all data available are for US books!*

See files test_core_ and test_ext_ for **a lot of examples**.

The exceptions raised by these methods can all be catched using ``ISBNLibException``.

You can extend the lib by using the classes and functions exposed in
namespace ``isbnlib.dev``, namely:

* ``WEBService`` a class that handles the access to web
  services (just by passing an url) and supports ``gzip``.
  You can subclass it to extend the functionality... but
  probably you don't need to use it! It is used in the next class.

* ``WEBQuery`` a class that uses ``WEBService`` to retrieve and parse
  data from a web service. You can build a new provider of metadata
  by subclassing this class.
  His main methods allow passing custom
  functions (*handlers*) that specialize them to specific needs (``data_checker`` and
  ``parser``). It implements a **throttling mechanism** with a default rate of
  one call per second per service.

* ``Metadata`` a class that structures, cleans and 'validates' records of
  metadata. His method ``merge`` allows to implement a simple merging
  procedure for records from different sources. The main features can be
  implemented by a call to ``stdmeta`` function!

* ``vias`` exposes several functions to put calls to services, just by passing the name and
  a pointer to the service's ``query`` function.
  ``vias.parallel`` allows to put threaded calls. You can use ``vias.serial``
  to make serial calls and
  ``vias.multi`` to use several cores. The default is ``vias.serial``, but
  you can change that in the conf file.


The exceptions raised by these methods can all be catched using ``ISBNLibDevException``.
You **should't raise** this exception in your code, only raise the specific exceptions
exposed in ``isbnlib.dev`` whose name end in Error.


In ``isbnlib.dev.helpers`` you can find several methods, that we found very useful, some of then
are only used in ``isbntools`` (*an app and framework* that uses ``isbnlib``).

With ``isbnlib.config`` you can read and set configuration options:
change timeouts with ``seturlopentimeout`` and ``setthreadstimeout``,
access api keys with ``apikeys`` and add new one with ``add_apikey``,
access and set generic and user-defined options with ``options.get('OPTION1')`` and ``set_option``.


Finally, from ``isbnlib.registry`` you can change the metadata service to be used by default
(``setdefaultservice``),
add a new service (``add_service``), access bibliographic formatters for metadata (``bibformatters``),
set the default formatter (``setdefaultbibformatter``), add new formatters (``add_bibformatter``) and
set a new cache (``set_cache``) (e.g. to switch off the chache ``set_cache(None)``).
The cache only works for calls through ``isbnlib.meta``. These changes only work for the 'current session',
so should be done always before calling other methods.


Let us concretize these points with a small example.

Suppose you want a small script to get metadata using ``Open Library`` formated in BibTeX.

A minimal script would be:


.. code-block:: python

    from isbnlib import meta
    from isbnlib.registry import bibformatters

    SERVICE = 'openl'

    # now you can use the service
    isbn = '9780446310789'
    bibtex = bibformatters['bibtex']
    print(bibtex(meta(isbn, SERVICE)))



All these classes follow a simple design pattern and, if you follow it, will be
very easy to integrate your classes with the rest of the lib.


Plugins
-------

You can extend the functionality of the library by adding pluggins (for now, just
new metadata providers or new bibliographic formatters).

Start with this template_ and follow the instructions there. For inspiration take a look
at goob_.

After install, your pluggin will blend transparently in ``isbnlib``.

Remember that plugins **must** support python 2.7 and python 3.4+ (see python-future.org_).

For available pluggins check_ here.



Extra Functionality
-------------------

To get extra functionality, search_ pypi for packages starting with ``isbnlib``
**or** type at a terminal:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip search isbnlib


for a nice formated report!



Merge Metadata
--------------

The original quality of metadata, at the several services, is not very good!
If you need high quality metadata in your app, the only solution is to use
*polling & merge* of several providers **and** a **lot** of cleaning and standardization
for fields like ``Authors`` and ``Publisher``.
A *simple merge* provider is now the default in ``isbnlib.meta``.
It gives priority to ``wcat`` but overwrites the ``Authors``, ``Publisher`` and ``Year``
fields with values from ``goob`` (if available) or ``openl``.
Uses the ``merge`` method of ``Metadata`` and *parallel* calls to services.

You can change that by using ``vias``'s other methods
(e.g. ``isbnlib.config.set_option('VIAS_MERGE', 'multi')``.

You can write your own *merging scheme* by creating a new provider (see_ ``merge`` for an example).

.. note:: These classes are optimized for one-calls to services and not for batch calls.


A full featured app!
--------------------

If you want a full featured app, that uses ``isbnlib``, with end user apps, configuration files and a
framework to further developement, take a look at isbntools_.
